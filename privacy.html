                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Time to Write’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>New Time to Write accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses.</p>

<p>You may optionally add an email address (Sign in with Apple) to your account at any time in Time to Write’s app. Email addresses are <strong>only</strong> used for logging in, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.</p>

<p>We store what you write to sync this information between your devices. We also collect analytics on app usage.</p>

<h3><strong>Technical basics</strong></h3>

<p>We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.</p>

<p>Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.</p>

<p>Time to Write uses the following services:<ul>
<li>Firebase (owned by Google): authentication, store what you write, analytics.</li>
<li>Sign in with Apple: optional account creation (to use multiple devices).</li>
<li>Sendgrid (owned by Twilio): optional sending email notifications.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Information usage</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Time to Write’s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people actively use Time to Write.</p>

<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

<p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS. We don't story passwords and rely on Sign in with Apple & Firebase for authentication.</p>

<h2>Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2>

<p>You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Time to Write iOS app.</p>

<p>Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.</p>

<p>Time to Write may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>

<h2>Third-party links and content</h2>

<p>Time to Write displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

<h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

<h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2>

<p>By using Time to Write and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p>

<h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>

<p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>

<p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email <a href="mailto:hello@timetowrite.app">hello@timetowrite.app</a>. <!--Please note that account deletion should be done within the Time to Write app, not via email requests, for security reasons.--></p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:</p>
